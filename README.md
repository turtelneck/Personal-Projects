<h3>Stuff I did for fun:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/turtelneck/Personal-Projects/tree/main/dating_bio">Dating Bio Tracker</a> | Sqlite DB
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/turtelneck/Personal-Projects/tree/main/pythagorean-theorum">Pythagorean Theorum</a> | sqrt() implemented from scratch
    </li>
</ul>
Dating Bio Tracker:
<ul>
    <li>A friend suggested that he saw lots of repeating dating bios, either identical or just very similar. So I made this console application. It accepts input about the girls and their bios, and then saves them to a Sqlite database, for the purpose of discovering which bios are the most common, and which words are used most often. It would also be able to match that against the age and occupation of the users the bios belong to. Potentially this could yield some interesting results, and the program itself was a lot of fun to create. The only problem? You have to type the bios in manually. So... neither me nor my friend bothered to take this experiment any further.</li>
</ul>
Pythagorean Theorum:
<ul>
    <li>For fun, I wanted to figure out how to create a manual implementation of sqrt() to create a web page that will calculate the Pythagorean Theorum. After several hours of obsessive research into Newton's Method, I finally came up with what you see here.</li>
</ul>
